# Senior-Project
IOS Mobile Application that Connects to a Mailbox Monitoring System.

## Purpose:

The main purpose of this IOS mobile-application is to notify you when you mailbox door has opened.

## Functionalities:

The functionalites include data that is sent by the hardware device I created placed in the mailbox by communicating via Bluetooth with your iPhone, then the data is coverted to display on the IOS mobile application I created. 

## Featured Pages:

Given six months to do the project, I could only implement the following featured pages to the IOS mobile-application.

### Home Page:

Click the Main Button to connect to the hardware device via Bluetooth. Fetches the stored data from the hardware device then based on the data a pop-up status page will display.

### Status Pages:

The pop-up status page will display one of the following images from the fetched data.

### History Page:

The history page is automated to create a custom table cell in a table I created upon each time the data is fetched from the Home page.
